<!-- presentation layer -> static web page 
Container layer -> dynamic web page





before 2018 :
1. Container layer -> dynamic web page -> class based component 
2. presentation layer => functional based components

2018 React version 16.8 , React Hooks were introduced in react functional based components

after 2018 

1. Container layer -> functional based components or class based components 

React suggesting always funtional based components  -->


Container layer --> data layer --> State 

State in class based components :


State creation in class based components can be done in 2 ways 
1. Object way of creation
2. Constructor way of creation


To change the state in react class based components we must use setState method
setState will accepts 2 args
1. Object or  Call back function 
2. Call back function  

when we use setState method component will re-render and updates the layout 
state changes are asynchrnous
